title: "When a /24 Is Too Small: DHCP Congestion, Quick Relief with Superscopes, and the Real Fix (VLANs)"
date: 2025-09-19 
description: We hit DHCP congestion on a flat /24. Here’s how we stabilized the network with temporary superscopes and a cleanup script—then redesigned with VLANs for the long term.

## TL;DR
A flat **/24** network for *everything* (servers, printers, switches, APs, clients, phones, IoT, cameras, …) finally ran out of steam.  
**Immediate relief:** we added **two temporary /24 scopes** in a **superscope** on Windows Server DHCP and put an **extra alias** on the firewall LAN plus rules for inter-LAN and internet.  
**Long-term fix:** split the network into **VLANs** (Infra, Office, BYOD, Guest Wi-Fi). To keep the temporary scopes from choking during shift changes, we added an **auto-clean** script that removes only **BAD_ADDRESS/Declined** leases when utilization exceeds a threshold.

---

## The problem
The client was suffering from **network congestion** and **DHCP scope exhaustion** on a classic **255.255.255.0 (/24)**. With the company’s growth, a single flat LAN for **servers/printers/switches/access points/clients/smartphones/IoT/cameras** is no longer realistic. Result: full scopes, BAD_ADDRESS entries, random connectivity issues.

---

## Immediate stabilization (same day)
1. **Windows Server DHCP superscope**  
   We created **two additional /24 scopes** and grouped them in a **superscope** to temporarily expand available addresses. These two ranges can later be re-used for VLANs.

2. **Firewall alias + rules**  
   We added an **extra alias IP** on the **LAN interface** and updated rules to:
   - allow **internet access** from the new subnets,
   - permit **LAN-to-LAN** access from the new subnets back to the original /24 (where needed).

This bought us breathing room without touching the existing reservations on the original subnet.

---

## The real solution: segment with VLANs
To make capacity, performance, and security match reality, we’re moving to VLANs:

- **Infra VLAN** — switches & access points (frees a big chunk of the /24).
- **Office VLAN** — servers, printers, wired clients.
- **Wi-Fi (3 SSIDs)**  
  - **Office** → Office VLAN  
  - **BYOD** → separate VLAN  
  - **Guest** → internet-only VLAN

Because there’s a mix of printers, cameras, IoT, etc., we’ll first **analyze the network**, then **upgrade/configure** gear to be VLAN-aware (switching, routing, DHCP helpers, SSID-to-VLAN mapping).

---

## Keeping the temporary scopes healthy
Shift work + long lease times can still congest the **temporary** scopes. As a safety net, we deploy an **automatic cleanup** that removes only **BAD_ADDRESS/Declined** leases when a scope goes above **80%** utilization. It leaves the **original scope** untouched to avoid impacting reservations.

### PowerShell: auto-clean BAD_ADDRESS/Declined leases
Save as `Clean-BadDhcpLeases.ps1` and run via a Scheduled Task (e.g., every 10 minutes).  
Replace the example scope IDs with your two temporary /24s (e.g., `10.10.17.0` and `10.10.18.0`).

```powershell
<#
.SYNOPSIS
  Cleans BAD_ADDRESS/Declined leases from Windows DHCP scopes.
.DESCRIPTION
  - Monitors selected scopes and, if utilization >= Threshold%, deletes BAD_ADDRESS/Declined leases.
  - Can also purge BAD_ADDRESS/Declined leases across all scopes immediately (-CleanAll).
.NOTES
  Requires: DHCPServer PowerShell module (on a DHCP role server or RSAT).

```

**What the script does (short):**
- Watches the **two temporary scopes** you specify.  
- When a scope is **≥ 80%** utilized, it **removes only BAD_ADDRESS/Declined** leases in that scope.  
- `-CleanAll` optionally purges BAD/Declined across **all scopes** once.  
- It never touches the **original scope** unless you include it in `ScopeIdsToAutoClean`.

**Suggested schedule:**
Run every 10 minutes as a Scheduled Task:
```text
powershell.exe -NoLogo -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Tools\Clean-BadDhcpLeases.ps1" -DhcpServer "DHCP-SERVER" -ScopeIdsToAutoClean 10.10.17.0,10.10.18.0 -Threshold 80
```

## Next steps
1. **Inventory & readiness**: confirm all switches/APs/firewall support VLANs, DHCP relay/helpers, and SSID-to-VLAN mapping.  
2. **Plan addressing**: per-VLAN CIDR, DHCP scopes, reservations, and options.  
3. **Migrate in waves**: move Infra first (switches/APs), then Office devices, then Wi-Fi SSIDs (Office/BYOD/Guest).  
4. **Tighten rules**: firewall inter-VLAN permissions (Office ↔ Infra, Guest → internet-only, BYOD limited).  
5. **Short leases during cutover** to reduce churn; return to normal after stabilization.

If you’re hitting similar symptoms on a flat /24, temporary superscopes can keep users working—**but VLANs are the real fix.**
