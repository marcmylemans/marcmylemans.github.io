> **TL;DR**: You can turn a cheap mini PC or an old desktop into a real home server in about 30 minutes. Install Proxmox VE (free), create your first virtual machine, and finish by running something useful like a network-wide ad blocker. You don't need a server rack, expensive hardware, or prior experience. This is the companion guide to the video, with every step written down so you can follow along at your own pace.
{: .prompt-tip }

If you have ever wanted your own home server but assumed it meant a noisy rack, a big electricity bill, and years of experience, this is for you. None of that is true. One small machine you already own, plus free software, gets you a real server you control, and you can have it running today.

This post is the written companion to my video. The video shows you the whole build; this guide is the reference you keep open while you do it, with the exact steps, the menu paths, and the one mistake that trips up almost every beginner.

## What you'll build

By the end you'll have:

- **Proxmox VE** installed on a spare machine, acting as your always-on server.
- **Your first virtual machine (VM)** running inside it, a separate computer living on your hardware.
- **One genuinely useful service** running on that VM, so the server does something real on day one, not just sit there empty.

A virtual machine, if the term is new, is just one physical box pretending to be several independent computers. Proxmox is the free software that makes that possible and gives you a clean web dashboard to manage it all.

## What you actually need

Three things, and none of them are expensive:

1. **A 64-bit machine with 4 to 8 GB of RAM.** A dusty old laptop, a second-hand mini PC, or a cheap refurbished desktop all work fine. You do not need server hardware to start.
2. **A USB stick of 8 GB or more.** This becomes the installer. Its contents get erased, so use an empty one.
3. **A second computer** to download the installer and, afterwards, to reach the server in your browser.

That's it. If you have an old machine gathering dust, your shopping list is one USB stick.

## Step 1: Download and flash Proxmox VE

1. On your normal computer, download the **Proxmox VE** installer ISO from the [official Proxmox downloads page](https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads). It's free.
2. Write that ISO to your USB stick with a flashing tool such as [balenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/) or [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) (Windows).

Two steps in and nothing has exploded. Good. That's the hardest part behind you.

## Step 2: Install Proxmox and first boot

1. Plug the USB stick into the machine that will become your server, and boot from it. The boot menu key is usually `F11`, `F12`, `DEL`, or `ESC` depending on the machine.
2. Choose **Install Proxmox VE** and walk through the installer: accept the licence, pick the **target disk** (this erases that disk, so choose the right one), set your country and timezone, and set a **root password** and an email address.
3. On the network screen, **write down the IP address** it shows you. That IP is how you'll reach the server from now on.
4. Finish the install, remove the USB stick, and let it reboot.

You'll land on a plain black login screen. Don't worry, you never really touch this screen again. Everything from here happens in your web browser.

## Step 3: Open the web dashboard

On your normal computer, open a browser and go to:

```text
https://YOUR-SERVER-IP:8006
```

Log in with user `root` and the password you set. Your browser will warn about the security certificate, that's expected on a fresh install, so continue through it.

For today, only three things in this dashboard matter: your server in the left-hand tree, where your VMs will live, and the **Create VM** button in the top right.

## Step 4: Get an OS image first (the step most guides skip)

Here's where almost every beginner gets stuck. A fresh Proxmox server has **no operating system images yet**, so when you click *Create VM*, the dropdown to pick an OS is empty and confusing. Do this first:

1. In the left tree, click your **local** storage.
2. Open the **ISO Images** tab.
3. Click **Download from URL**.
4. Paste the download link for the OS you want (a lightweight Linux server like Debian or Ubuntu Server is perfect for a first VM), click **Query URL**, then **Download**.

Proxmox pulls the image straight onto the server itself. Nothing downloads to your own PC, and you don't upload anything. This one step is the difference between a smooth build and ten minutes of head-scratching.

## Step 5: Create your first virtual machine

1. Click **Create VM**.
2. Give it a name.
3. On the **OS** tab, pick the ISO you just downloaded (and this time it's actually sitting right there).
4. Sensible starter resources: **2 CPU cores, 2 GB RAM, 20 GB disk**.
5. Finish, then select the VM and click **Start**, then **Console**.

Watch it boot. You are now looking at a brand-new, separate computer running inside your server. That's the whole point of virtualization: one box, many machines.

## Step 6: Run something genuinely useful

Don't stop at an empty VM. Install one service you'll actually use, so the server earns its keep on day one. A great first choice is a **network-wide ad blocker** (such as Pi-hole or AdGuard Home): it runs on your new VM and blocks ads and trackers for *every* device on your network, including your phone, no per-device setup.

That first moment when something you built just works, on every device in the house, is exactly why people fall down the homelab rabbit hole.

## Where to go next

You now have the foundation for everything else: more VMs, self-hosted apps, backups, and reaching your services securely from outside the house. Each of those is its own project, and a natural next step once this base is solid.

## FAQ

**Do I need expensive or special hardware for a home server?**
No. Any 64-bit machine with 4 to 8 GB of RAM works, including an old laptop or a cheap second-hand mini PC. You do not need server-grade hardware to start.

**Is Proxmox VE free?**
Yes. Proxmox VE is free and open-source. There's an optional paid subscription for an enterprise update channel, but you don't need it for a home lab.

**What's the difference between Proxmox and just installing apps on the machine?**
Proxmox is a hypervisor, it lets one physical machine run several isolated virtual machines at once. You get separation, easy snapshots, and the freedom to rebuild a VM without touching the others.

**Why is the "Create VM" OS dropdown empty?**
Because the server has no OS images yet. Download one first via your **local** storage, **ISO Images**, **Download from URL**, and it will then appear in the Create VM wizard.

**Can I use a USB stick to run the server long-term?**
Use the USB only as the installer. Install Proxmox onto an internal SSD or HDD; running the system off a USB stick long-term wears it out quickly.

**How much RAM does my first VM need?**
2 GB is plenty for a lightweight Linux server VM running a service like an ad blocker. You can adjust resources later as you add more.
