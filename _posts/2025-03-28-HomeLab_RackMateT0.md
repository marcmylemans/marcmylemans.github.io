## Intro

Looking for a clean, compact way to house your homelab hardware? In this post, I’ll walk you through unboxing and assembling the [**DeskPi Rackmate T0**](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0DPGZPTPP), and how I used it to build a powerful yet whisper-quiet Proxmox cluster using three HP Mini PCs.

## What’s in the Box?

The packaging is layered, and everything is well protected. Here’s what you get:

- Instruction manual with step-by-step guidance  
- Side panels, handles, and top brace  
- Two included screwdrivers  
- Acrylic top cover  
- Full screw set—no extra hardware needed  
- 1U front filler panel and bottom plate  
- 1U Hidden shelf (under the toolset!)

## Assembly + My Homelab Story

While assembling the rack, I shared my homelab story—starting from a single desktop, to a noisy 2U server, and eventually to a quiet, efficient micro-cluster.

### My current setup:

- 3× HP ProDesk 600 G4 Mini PCs  
- Each with: i3-8100T, 32GB RAM, 2TB NVMe, 2.5GbE networking  
- Running: Proxmox for virtualization, Ceph for shared storage  
- Connected via 2.5GbE switch

## Power and Mounting

I added a 10-inch PDU to the bottom of the rack. There’s a gap underneath—perfect for tucking away the power cable.

Also installed the included shelf and demoed the blank panel. All parts mount directly to the front rails—no cage nuts required.

## Final Showcase

Here are a few shots of the completed build:

- **Inside:** power and network neatly managed  
- **Front view:** super minimal—switch is hidden     
- **Now:** Rack mounted in the Kallax

## What Would You Do?

Would you:

1. Keep the rack **displayed in your office** (inside a Kallax)?  
2. Or **hide it in the utility closet** for a cleaner space?

Let me know in the comments!
