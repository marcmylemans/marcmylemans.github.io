## Intro

Looking for a clean, compact way to house your homelab hardware? In this post, I‚Äôll walk you through unboxing and assembling the [**DeskPi Rackmate T0**](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0DPGZPTPP), and how I used it to build a powerful yet whisper-quiet Proxmox cluster using three HP Mini PCs.

- Side panels, handles, and top brace

## Assembly + My Homelab Story

While assembling the rack, I shared my homelab story‚Äîstarting from a single desktop, to a noisy 2U server, and eventually to a quiet, efficient micro-cluster.

### My current setup:

- 3√ó HP ProDesk 600 G4 Mini PCs  
- Each with: i3-8100T, 32GB RAM, 2TB NVMe, 2.5GbE networking  
- Running: Proxmox for virtualization, Ceph for shared storage  
- Connected via 2.5GbE switch

## Power and Mounting

I added a 10-inch PDU to the bottom of the rack. There‚Äôs a gap underneath‚Äîperfect for tucking away the power cable.

Also installed the included shelf and demoed the blank panel. All parts mount directly to the front rails‚Äîno cage nuts required.

## What Would You Do?

Would you:

1. Keep the rack **displayed in your office** (inside a Kallax)?  
2. Or **hide it in the utility closet** for a cleaner space?
