# Enhancing Connectivity - The 2.5 Gbit Network Upgrade

As [My New Home Lab](https://mylemans.online/posts/NewHomeLab/) evolves, I'm thrilled to share the latest advancement: the transition to a **2.5 Gbit network**. This upgrade marks a significant leap in networking capabilities, aligning perfectly with my future plans for high-performance tasks.

## The Need for Speed: Why 2.5 Gbit?

In a tech environment where data transfer and processing speed are paramount, the upgrade to a **2.5 Gbit network** is more than a luxury—it's a necessity. The increased bandwidth will cater to:

- **Large-scale simulations**: Handling complex computational tasks seamlessly.
- **Intensive data processing**: Ensuring quicker data throughput for analysis and storage.
- **High-speed file transfers**: Making the sharing of large files within the lab a breeze.

## The Upgrade Process: Integrating New Hardware

The core of this upgrade lies in integrating state-of-the-art network hardware capable of supporting 2.5 Gbit speeds. Here's what I've done:

## Adding a Second Network Adapter

To facilitate the upgrade to a 2.5 Gbit network, I've made a significant change to my setup by replacing the existing Wi-Fi module with a new network adapter. The selected model is a versatile **M.2 to E 2.5G Ethernet Adapter**. This adapter isn't just about increased speed; it's about enhanced connectivity and superior data transfer rates.

This strategic replacement not only elevates the network's performance but also ensures multi-gigabit connectivity, crucial for the advanced tasks I plan to undertake in my home lab.

## Next Steps: Network Configuration and Testing

With the new hardware in place, the next phase involves configuring the network settings and conducting extensive tests to ensure optimal performance. This includes:

- **Network Card Configuration**: Setting up the network cards for maximum throughput.
- **Bandwidth Testing**: Verifying the actual speeds achieved and tweaking settings for improvement.
- **Stress Testing**: Simulating high-demand scenarios to test the network's resilience and reliability.


## Integrating a Temporary 2.5 Gbit Switch

As an interim step in my home lab's networking upgrade, I've incorporated a temporary but pivotal piece of hardware: a **2.5 Gbit switch**. This switch is crucial for testing and transitioning my lab to the enhanced speeds that the 2.5 Gbit network promises.

## The Role of the 2.5 Gbit Switch

The temporary switch, an elegant and compact solution, plays a key role in the upgrade process:

- **Testing Ground**: It serves as the testing ground for the new network capabilities, allowing me to experiment with configurations and performance tuning.
- **Seamless Integration**: Despite being a temporary solution, it integrates seamlessly with my existing hardware, ensuring no disruption to my current projects.
- **Performance Evaluation**: It provides a real-world scenario to evaluate the performance enhancements offered by the 2.5 Gbit connectivity.

## Setting Up the Switch

Installing this switch was straightforward:

- **Connection**: I connected the switch to my existing network, linking it with the newly installed M.2 to E 2.5G Ethernet Adapter.
- **Configuration**: Minimal configuration was needed, thanks to the switch's plug-and-play nature.
- **Testing**: Post-installation, I conducted several tests to ensure the network was functioning at the expected 2.5 Gbit speed.

## Future Plans

While this switch is a temporary component of my lab, it sets the stage for a more permanent and robust 2.5 Gbit networking solution. In the upcoming chapters, I'll detail the selection and integration of a permanent 2.5 Gbit switch and other enhancements to further solidify my home lab's networking prowess.

This network upgrade isn't just a technical enhancement; it's a gateway to new possibilities in my home lab. It sets the stage for handling more sophisticated projects and experiments, pushing the boundaries of what I can achieve in this personal tech haven.

Stay tuned as I delve into more complex projects and share my experiences and learnings. The journey of my home lab continues to be an exciting and educational one, and I'm eager to explore the new horizons this upgrade opens up.

*Stay tuned for more updates as my high-speed networking adventure continues!*

## Addendum: Driver Update for Full 2.5 Gbit Speed

### Driver Limitation with Windows Update

After integrating the new **M.2 to E 2.5G Ethernet Adapter**, I encountered a limitation with the built-in drivers provided by Windows Update. These drivers restricted the adapter's functionality to only 1 Gbit, which was not the full capability of the hardware.

### Acquiring the Correct Drivers from Realtek

To unleash the full potential of the 2.5 Gbit network, I needed to manually download and install the appropriate drivers from Realtek. Here's how I addressed this:

1. **Realtek Website**: I visited the Realtek website to find the specific drivers for my network interface controller. The drivers are available at [Realtek Network Interface Controllers Drivers](https://www.realtek.com/en/component/zoo/category/network-interface-controllers-10-100-1000m-gigabit-ethernet-pci-express-software).

2. **Specific Driver Download**: I downloaded the driver for Server 2019. The direct link to the driver is [Install_Win10_10069_12212023.zip](https://rtitwww.realtek.com/rtdrivers/cn/nic1/Install_Win10_10069_12212023.zip).

3. **Installation**: After downloading, I installed the driver on my Server 2019 setup, which was a straightforward process.

### Outcome

Post driver installation, the network adapter operated at its full 2.5 Gbit capacity. This not only resolved the speed limitation but also ensured that my home lab network could handle more demanding tasks efficiently.

*This driver update was a crucial step in achieving the desired performance from my upgraded network.*
