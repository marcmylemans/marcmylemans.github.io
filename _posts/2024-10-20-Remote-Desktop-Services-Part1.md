## Part 2: Installing Remote Desktop Services (RDS)

### Step 1: Adding Servers to Server Manager

1. Open **Server Manager** from the Start menu or taskbar.
2. In the left-hand pane, right-click **All Servers** and select **Add Servers**.
3. In the **Active Directory** dialog box, click **Find Now** to display a list of available servers.
4. Select the servers **RDGW** (Remote Desktop Gateway) and **RDS1** (Remote Desktop Session Host) from the list, and click **Add**.
5. Click **OK** to close the dialog box.

With both servers added to Server Manager, you’re now ready to install and configure the core RDS roles.

### Step 2: Installing RDS Roles

1. Open **Server Manager** again, and click **Add Roles and Features** from the Dashboard.
2. In the wizard, choose **Remote Desktop Services Installation** and click **Next**.
3. Select **Standard Deployment** and choose **Session-based desktop deployment** for a virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI).
4. Assign the RDS roles as follows:
   - **Connection Broker**: Assign to **RDGW** – The Connection Broker manages session connections and ensures load balancing.
   - **Web Access**: Assign to **RDGW** – This role enables users to access RemoteApp and desktop resources via a web browser.
   - **Session Host**: Assign to **RDS1** – This is the server that hosts the Remote Desktop sessions for users.

After assigning the roles, proceed with the installation and configure any additional settings as needed.


### Step 3: Configuring RDS Certificates

To secure Remote Desktop Services (RDS) traffic, you'll need an SSL certificate. Follow these steps to set it up using **[Certify The Web](https://certifytheweb.com/)**:

1. Download and install **Certify The Web** on your server.
2. Request a certificate for your **public DNS name** and apply it to **IIS**.
3. Export the certificate and import it into **Server Manager** under **Remote Desktop Services > Edit Deployment Properties**.
4. Assign the certificate to the following RDS roles:
   - **Connection Broker**: *(If you have set up your CA correctly and enabled Certificate Services Client - Auto Enrollment, you don't need to assign a certificate here manually.)*
   - **Web Access**
   - **Gateway**

By following these steps, you’ll ensure that SSL encryption is applied to your RDS environment, securing communication between the servers and clients.


### Step 4: Configuring Remote Desktop Licensing

1. Open **Edit Deployment Properties** in **Server Manager**.
2. Navigate to **RD Licensing** and select **Per User** mode for licensing.

## Part 3: Configuring FSLogix for User Profiles

FSLogix optimizes user profile management in RDS environments, offering faster logins and smoother session experiences.

### Step 1: Downloading and Installing FSLogix

1. Download the latest version of **[FSLogix](https://aka.ms/fslogix-latest)** from Microsoft's website.
2. Install FSLogix on each Remote Desktop Session Host server.

### Step 2: Configuring FSLogix Profiles

To properly store and manage user profiles in a Remote Desktop Services environment, you’ll use **FSLogix** for handling profiles and Office 365 data. Here’s how to set it up:

### 1. Create Shared Folders for Profiles and Containers
1. Create two shared folders to store user profiles and containers:
   - `\\DC1\FSLogix_Profiles`
   - `\\DC1\FSLogix_Containers`
2. Set appropriate folder permissions to ensure secure access for users and the system.

### Folder Permissions Setup

Here’s the recommended permission configuration for the profile folder (`FSLogix_Profiles`), which will ensure proper access for users and administrators:

| Principal               | Access                  | Applies to                      | Description                                                                                                                                  |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CREATOR OWNER**        | Modify (Read / Write)   | Subfolders and files only        | Ensures the profile directory created by the user has the correct permissions, granting exclusive access to the user who owns the folder.      |
| **CONTOSO\Domain Admins**| Full Control            | This folder, subfolders, and files| Administrative group with full control over the folder and its contents. Replace with your organization's administrative group.               |
| **CONTOSO\Domain Users** | Modify (Read / Write)   | This folder only                 | Allows authorized users to create their profile directory at the top-level folder. Replace with the group that contains the users needing access.|

> Replace `CONTOSO` with your organization's domain name as necessary.

These permissions ensure that:
- Each user has exclusive access to their own profile folder (via **CREATOR OWNER** permissions).
- Admins can manage all profiles with **Full Control**.
- Regular users can create their profile folder but cannot modify or delete other users' profiles.

### 2. Configure FSLogix Group Policies

You will configure FSLogix settings through Group Policy to manage the profile and ODFC Containers.
Locate the two files (fslogix.admx and fslogix.adml) and copy them to a location based on a local or central store configuration.

Navigate to `Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > FSLogix` for each of the following settings:

#### ODFC Containers

## Part 4: Setting Up Single Sign-On (SSO)

Single Sign-On (SSO) enhances the user experience by allowing users to sign in once and access multiple services seamlessly.

### Step 1: Configuring SSO Policies

1. Create a new Group Policy called `Computer Policy - Enable RDP SSO`.
2. Enable:
   - `Allow delegating default credentials` under `Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > System > Credentials Delegation`.
   - Set the policy to use: `TERMSRV/*.domain.local`.
3. Create another Group Policy called `User Policy - Enable RD Gateway SSO`.
4. In this policy, configure:
   - `RD Gateway Authentication Method` under `User Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Remote Desktop Services > RD Gateway`.
   - **RD Gateway Authentication Method** to use **locally logged-on credentials**.

### Step 2: Configuring Web Feed for RemoteApp Connections

1. Create a new Group Policy named `User Policy - Enable RDP Webfeed`.
2. Set the **default connection URL** to your RDS Web Access feed:
   - `Specify default connection URL` under `User Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Remote Desktop Services > RemoteApp and Desktop COnnections`.
   - Example: `https://yourpublicdns/rdweb/feed/webfeed.aspx`.

## Part 5: Creating a Desktop Collection with Your Remote Desktop Session Host

Now that we've set up the foundational pieces of Remote Desktop Services (RDS), it's time to create a desktop collection, which is where users will access their remote sessions. Follow the steps below to create and configure the desktop collection.

### Step 1: Creating the Session Collection

1. Open **Server Manager**.
2. In the left-hand menu, click **Remote Desktop Services**, then under **Collections**, select **Tasks** and click **Create Session Collection**.
3. The wizard will open. Give your collection a name—let's use **Remote Desktop Sessions** for this guide.
4. In the next step, select the **RDS1** virtual machine as the **Session Host** server for this collection.
5. For the **User Groups**, select **Domain Users**. This will allow all users in the default domain group to access the collection. You can create custom groups if you want to restrict access to specific users.

   > **Tip:** You can further refine who has access by selecting specific security groups rather than the entire domain users group.

### Step 2: Disabling User Profile Disks

6. When you reach the step to **Specify User Profile Disks**, ensure **this option is not enabled**. We’re using **FSLogix** for user profile management, so enabling this feature here would conflict with FSLogix.

   > **Important:** FSLogix manages user profiles more efficiently, so there’s no need to use the built-in user profile disk feature of RDS.

### Step 3: Completing the Collection Creation

7. Finish the wizard by reviewing the settings and clicking **Create**. Once completed, your **Remote Desktop Sessions** collection will be available and configured for use.
8. Users in the specified groups can now log in and access the session hosts via Remote Desktop.

## Part 6: Demonstrating Single Sign-On (SSO) and Web Feed from a Client Device

Now that we’ve set up the infrastructure, let’s see how your users can easily access their Remote Desktop sessions and apps using **Single Sign-On (SSO)** and the **RemoteApp Web Feed**. This setup ensures a seamless experience where users don’t have to re-enter their credentials or manually configure connections.

### Step 1: Open the Start Menu

On your client device, follow these steps:

1. **Open the Start Menu**.
   - If you’ve configured the **RemoteApp Web Feed** correctly, you’ll notice that the remote desktop session or any published apps are automatically populated under **Work Resources** or **RemoteApp and Desktop Connections** in the Start Menu.
   
   > **Note:** The Web Feed automatically pulls in the resources from your RDS environment and displays them without any manual configuration by the user.

### Step 2: Select the Remote Desktop Session

2. From the Start Menu, click on the **Remote Desktop Session** (or any other published apps) to launch it.

3. Notice how you **don’t need to enter credentials again**—this is thanks to the **Single Sign-On (SSO)** that we configured earlier.

   > **Tip:** SSO allows your users to authenticate once when they log into their local machine or domain and seamlessly access their remote desktops or applications without having to log in again.

### Step 3: Seamless Access to Remote Desktop

Once clicked, the **Remote Desktop Session** will open, and the user is immediately logged in using their domain credentials—**no additional logins required**.

- Users can now navigate their remote desktop, access files, and use applications just as if they were directly connected to the server.
  
- **FSLogix** ensures that their profile is loaded quickly and efficiently, providing a consistent experience across sessions.


## Conclusion

Congratulations! 🎉 You've successfully set up a complete Remote Desktop Services environment using Windows Server 2022. With SSL certificates for secure access, FSLogix for user profile management, and Single Sign-On for a seamless user experience, your RDS setup is now fully operational and ready to support multiple users.
