Part 7 of our Remote Desktop Services series for Windows Server 2022 dives into enhancing security with Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). In this tutorial, we'll install the Azure MFA NPS Extension to secure the Remote Desktop Gateway connections.

### Implementing Azure MFA in RDS

We cover:

- **Azure MFA NPS Extension Installation**: Step-by-step guidance on integrating Azure MFA with your Remote Desktop Services.
- **Configuring for Enhanced Security**: How to use Azure AD's multifactor authentication to secure RDS connections.

### Key Installation Steps

Here are the essential PowerShell commands and registry settings for setting up Azure MFA:

1) Download the NPS Extension: [Download NPS Extension](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54688)

2) Run these PowerShell commands:
    ```powershell
    cd 'c:\Program Files\Microsoft\AzureMfa\Config'
    .\AzureMfaNpsExtnConfigSetup.ps1
    ```

3) To allow Non MFA users to connect, add this registry key:
    ```cmd
    reg add HKLM\Software\Microsoft\AzureMFA /v REQUIRE_USER_MATCH /t REG_SZ /d FALSE
    ```
    Then, reboot the server for the changes to take effect.

### Why Azure MFA?

- **Enhanced Security**: Adding an extra layer of authentication significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
- **Flexibility**: Azure MFA offers various methods of verification, accommodating different user preferences and scenarios.
- **Compliance**: Meet security standards and compliance requirements for remote access.
