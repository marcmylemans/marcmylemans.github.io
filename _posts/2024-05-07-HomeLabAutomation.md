# Automating Your RDS Lab: From ISO to Full Deployment with PowerShell

Setting up a Remote Desktop Services (RDS) lab doesn't need to take hours of manual work. With my PowerShell-based [HomeLab project](https://github.com/marcmylemans/HomeLab), you can build a fully automated Hyper-V test environmentâ€”from converting an ISO into a deployable template all the way to configuring your RDS stack.

In this blog post, Iâ€™ll walk you through the complete process, combining two core automation scripts:

1. **Template Builder** â€“ Converts a Windows Server ISO into a fully-prepped VHDX using Unattended setup.
2. **RDS Lab Deployer** â€“ Spins up VMs, creates a domain, joins servers, and configures RDSâ€”all from a JSON config.

---

## Step 1: Creating the VHDX Template from ISO

Before we can automate the lab deployment, we need a Windows Server template disk image. Thatâ€™s where the `TemplateBuilder/main.ps1` script comes in.

It uses the excellent [Convert-WindowsImage](https://github.com/x0nn/Convert-WindowsImage) PowerShell module to:

- Extract a chosen Windows edition from an ISO  
- Apply an **Unattend.xml** file for automatic setup, a sample file is included or you can generate an answer file on [Windows Answer File Generator](https://www.windowsafg.com/).
- Output a bootable VHDX, ready for Hyper-V deployment  

### PowerShell Snippet

```powershell
Convert-WindowsImage -SourcePath $isoPath `
    -VHDFormat "VHDX" `
    -DiskLayout "UEFI" `
    -Edition "Windows Server 2022 Standard (Desktop Experience)" `
    -VHDPath $vhdPath `
    -SizeBytes 64GB `
    -UnattendPath $unattendPath `
    -Feature "NetFx3"
```

Once this runs, youâ€™ve got a pre-configured VHDX ready to be cloned into multiple VMs.

## Step 2: Deploying the RDS Lab

Now that we have our base image, the real magic begins.

Edit the `Remote Desktop Services/config.json` file to set up your environment. It should include:

- VM names, IPs.
- Domain controller configuration.
- RDS setup details.
- VM template paths.
- Network configurations.

Example:
```json
{
    "VMs": [
        {"Name": "dc1", "IP": "192.168.48.10"},
        {"Name": "rdgw", "IP": "192.168.48.11"},
        {"Name": "rds1", "IP": "192.168.48.12"},
        {"Name": "rds2", "IP": "192.168.48.13"}
    ],
    "DomainController": "dc1",
    "TemplateVHDXPath": "C:\\Hyper-V\\Virtual Hard Disks\\Templates\\template_server2019.vhdx",
    "VMStoragePath": "C:\\Hyper-V\\Virtual Machines",
    "VMSwitch": "vSwitch",
    "DomainName": "homelab.local",
    "AdminUsername": "Administrator",
    "AdminPassword": "Azerty123!",
    "SubnetMask": 24,
    "Gateway": "192.168.48.254",
    "DNS": "192.168.48.10",
    "RDS": {
        "connectionBrokerVM": "dc1",
        "ConnectionBroker": "rdgw.homelab.local",
        "WebAccessServer": "rdgw.homelab.local",
        "SessionHost": "rds1.homelab.local",
        "LicenseServer": "rdgw.homelab.local",
        "HostRemoteApp": "rds2.homelab.local",
        "GatewayExternalFqdn": "rdgw.homelab.com",
        "SessionCollectionName": "RDS Host",
        "RemoteAppCollectionName": "RDS Remote App",
        "UserGroupSession": ["homelab\\domain users", "homelab\\domain admins"],
        "UserGroupRemoteApp": ["homelab\\domain users", "homelab\\domain admins"]
    }
}
```

The `Remote Desktop Services/main.ps1` script handles:

- VM creation and static IP assignment  
- Network configuration via PowerShell remoting  
- Domain controller promotion  
- Domain join for other VMs  
- Full Remote Desktop Services role setup  

### How to Use It

1. **Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marcmylemans/HomeLab.git
```

2. **Edit `config.json`**  
Define your VM names, IPs, domain name, and RDS preferences.

3. **Run the script**

Set execution policy to Unrestricted for the current session

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process -Force
```

Unblock all files in the folder

```powershell
Get-ChildItem | Unblock-File
```
Run the script

```powershell
.
.\main.ps1
```

And voilÃ : Your test lab is online!

Whether you're learning, testing, or just geeking out:  
**Automate the boring stuffâ€”then tweak it for fun.**

Stay efficient, stay curious,
