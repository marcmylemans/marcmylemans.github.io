Welcome to another Mylemans Online project! I recently added the **Creality K1 Max** to my maker toolbox to support my **Rackmate T0 homelab project**—and I’m loving the results.

## 📦 Unboxing the Beast

The K1 Max is a solid, pre-assembled CoreXY printer with a massive build volume and lightning-fast speeds. Right out of the box, it felt premium and ready to work.

> ⚠️ The unboxing footage was shot at night because, yes, the printer arrived at **10 PM**, and I just couldn’t wait. I filmed it on my phone, so please excuse the lighting and wobbly shots. But hey, that’s the joy of a new gadget, right?

## 🔧 First-Time Setup

After unboxing, the K1 Max is almost plug-and-play. Here’s what I had to do:

- Remove all the protective stickers
- Connect the display to the ribbon cable (this took some effort one-handed while filming 😅)
- Remove three shipping screws under the print bed

Once powered on, the printer guides you through:

- Language selection
- WiFi connection
- Auto-calibration sequence

It also comes with a spool of **white filament**, which I used for testing.  
I ordered some **black filament** for the actual rackmounts—should arrive soon!

## 🛠️ Installing OrcaSlicer

To slice my prints, I’m using **OrcaSlicer**, a free and powerful slicer favored by the 3D printing community.

### Step-by-step:
1. **Download and run the installer** from the [official OrcaSlicer website](https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/releases/latest). It’s a quick and easy setup.
2. Upon first launch, a **setup wizard** appears to guide you through the basics.
3. Search and select **“K1 Max”** from the printer list.
4. OrcaSlicer will **automatically preload Creality filament profiles**, so common materials like PLA, PETG, and ABS are ready to go.
5. Follow [this excellent guide](https://guilouz.github.io/Creality-Helper-Script-Wiki/slicers/orcaslicer/) to:
   - Import the custom K1 Max build plate
   - Load optimized printer and filament config files
   - Copy/paste custom **start and end G-code** for best printing results

It’s a clean, fast setup that gets you printing with confidence.

## 🖼️ OrcaSlicer Setup – Step-by-Step Screenshots

To make things easier, I’ve documented every step of my OrcaSlicer setup with screenshots.

These visual guides are especially helpful if you’re just starting out.

## 🔍 Finding 3D Models

You can find STL files on platforms like:
- [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/)
- [Printables](https://www.printables.com/)

For this video, I demo a [**Goku figurine**](https://www.printables.com/model/1233340-2025-hegehog-goku-style-fdm-supportless/files) and previewed a rackmount print for an [**HP ProDesk 600 G4 Mini**](https://www.printables.com/model/585091-10-inch-rackmount-for-mini-hp-prodesk-elitedesk-g1).

## 🖨️ Demo Print

As a warm-up, I printed a small Goku figure in about 30 minutes. The print quality was excellent, with smooth lines and great detail for such a fast job.

## 📌 What’s Next?

I’ll be printing more rack-mount accessories, tools, and enclosures to level up the homelab. If you're into 3D printing and IT tinkering, make sure to follow along!

Stay tuned,
