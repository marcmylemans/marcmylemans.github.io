# Introduction

If youâ€™re running Proxmox VE, backups are not optional, theyâ€™re essential.  
Proxmox Backup Server (PBS) is the official backup solution for Proxmox environments, offering deduplication and encryption with fast restores.

In this guide, weâ€™ll walk through what PBS is, why it matters, and how to install and configure it step-by-step using Proxmox Backup Server and Proxmox VE.

## What Is Proxmox Backup Server?

Proxmox Backup Server is a dedicated backup and restore platform designed to protect your virtual machines, containers, and configuration data from your Proxmox VE nodes.

It supports:
- **Block-level deduplication**
- **Compression**
- **Encryption**
- **Incremental backups**
- **Fast restore operations**

PBS integrates seamlessly with Proxmox VE, and even supports remote sync and offsite replication for advanced users.

## System Requirements

For most home lab environments, PBS runs perfectly on a low-power mini-PC or an old server.

**Recommended minimum specs:**
- Modern AMD or Intel 64-bit based CPU, with at least 4 cores
- 4 GB RAM
- 32 GB system disk (SSD preferred)
- Separate disk for backup datastore (HDD or NAS)
- 1 Gbps network interface

## Step 1: Download and Install PBS 4

1. Visit [Proxmox Downloads](https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads)  
2. Download the latest **Proxmox Backup Server 4.x ISO**  
3. Flash it to a USB drive using [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) or Rufus  
4. Boot your mini-PC from the USB and start the installation wizard  
5. Configure hostname (e.g., `pbs.lab.mylemans.online`), timezone, and network settings  

Once complete, youâ€™ll see a message like:

```
https://pbs.lab.mylemans.online:8007
```

Open that address in your browser to access the PBS web interface.

## Step 2: Create a Datastore

1. Log in using `root@pam`  
2. Go to **Configuration â†’ Datastores â†’ Add**  
3. Name your datastore (e.g., `main-store`)  
4. Select your disk path (e.g., `/mnt/datastore`)  

If you use ZFS, ensure your pool is created and mounted first.

## Step 3: Connect Proxmox VE 9 to PBS

1. On your Proxmox VE node, navigate to:  
   `Datacenter â†’ Storage â†’ Add â†’ Proxmox Backup Server`  
2. Enter:
   - Server address  
   - Datastore name  
   - User credentials (`root@pam`)  
3. Click **Fingerprint â†’ Verify**, then **Add**

Your PBS will now appear as available storage in Proxmox VE.

## Step 4: Schedule Backups

1. Go to **Datacenter â†’ Backup â†’ Add**  
2. Select your VMs and PBS storage  
3. Choose **Snapshot Mode** and a daily or weekly schedule  
4. Save and test your backup

## Step 5: Test Restores

1. Go to **Datacenter â†’ Backup**  
2. Select a backup and click **Restore**  
3. Choose your node and storage target  
4. Start the restore process and confirm your VM boots correctly
