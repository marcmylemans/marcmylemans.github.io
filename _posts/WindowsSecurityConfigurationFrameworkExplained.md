Hardening Windows securely is harder than it should be.

Too often, environments rely on:
- Random GPO templates
- Overly strict CIS settings
- Inconsistent security policies across systems

Microsoft actually provides an official solution:  
the **Windows Security Configuration Framework**, delivered through the [**Security Compliance Toolkit**](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=55319).


## What Is It?

The framework provides **Microsoft-tested security baselines** for Windows systems.

These baselines are designed to:
- Improve security
- Maintain usability
- Stay supported by Microsoft

## What’s Included?

### Security Baselines
Predefined policies for:
- Windows 10 / 11
- Windows Server
- Microsoft Defender

### LGPO (Local Group Policy Object)
Apply security baselines **without Active Directory**.  
Ideal for labs, templates, and standalone systems.

### Policy Analyzer
Compare:
- Existing GPOs
- Local policies
- Microsoft baselines

This helps detect configuration drift and security gaps.

### GPO Backups
Import-ready Group Policy Objects for enterprise environments.

## Where This Fits

**Enterprise IT**  
Baseline first, exceptions later.

**Intune / MDM**  
Aligns cleanly with Microsoft security posture.

**Homelabs & Learning**  
Learn real-world Windows hardening the right way.

## Final Thoughts

If you manage Windows systems and care about security,  
this toolkit should be part of your standard workflow.

In a follow-up guide, we’ll apply a baseline and analyze the impact live.
